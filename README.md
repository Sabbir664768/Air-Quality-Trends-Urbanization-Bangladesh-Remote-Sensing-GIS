# Air-Quality-Trends-Urbanization-Bangladesh-Remote-Sensing-GIS

**Abstract**

Rapid urbanization has led to significant land cover changes and air quality challenges in many regions, including 
Bangladesh. This study aims to investigate the relationship between urban land use changes and air quality and 
analyze trends in air quality in Sylhet, Dhaka, and Chittagong. Urbanization was estimated using Landsat imagery, 
while air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, CO, O3, NO2, SO2) from 2003 to 2021 were collected from 
ECMWF EAC4 reanalysis data. GIS and remote sensing techniques were employed to visualize. Statistical 
analyses including Pearson correlation were used to explore the relationship between urban land use changes and 
air quality, alongside Mann-Kendall tests, and Sen's slope for trend analysis. Sen's Slope analysis revealed 
significant and concerning trends in air pollutant concentrations in the cities of Sylhet, Chittagong, and Dhaka. 
Notably, in Dhaka, PM2.5 and PM10 levels exhibited alarming annual increases of 1.64 micrograms per cubic meter 
and 2.30 micrograms per cubic meter, respectively, while CO levels surged by a staggering 10.72 parts per million 
(ppm) per year. Similarly, in Sylhet, CO levels showed a concerning annual increase of 3.06 ppm. The air quality 
variables exhibited high averages in Dhaka, medium averages in Sylhet, and low averages in Chittagong. 
Chittagong had high levels of Ozone (O3), while Sylhet had low levels. Moreover, the strong positive correlations 
(above 0.90) between urbanization and air pollutant levels emphasize the profound impact of urban expansion on 
worsening air quality in these Bangladeshi cities. The rate of urbanization was higher in Chittagong but 
significantly lower in Sylhet. The percentage of vegetation in Dhaka was relatively lower compared to other cities. 
Vegetation and water bodies were decreasing day by day. Findings from this study reveal alarming trends in air 
pollutant concentrations in major Bangladeshi cities, indicating a significant decline in air quality.
